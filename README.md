Define a grid for the domain of the function

X = [a,b]
Y = [c,d]
D = X x Y


## Necessary libraries to run this program

- OpenGL 2.0 (freeglut)
- SFML 

## Quick Installation of these libraries
To install the above libraries, run the following shell commands on linux (Ubuntu)

```
    sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
    sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
    sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev
```
Or all together as

```
    sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev libboost-all-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev
